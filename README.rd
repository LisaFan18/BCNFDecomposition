In this project, I wroted a program that computes the BCNF decomposition of a pair (relation, functional dependencies)
It has the following functions: 
1. Compute functional dependencies 
inputs is a file with a relation and a set of functional dependencies
outputs are all non-trivial functional dependencies 
2. Check BCNF violations 
3. Compute the BCNF decomposition of a given relation and a set of functional dependencies
